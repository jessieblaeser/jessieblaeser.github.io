            <p>When it comes to the Atlanta Hawks, I like to think there‚Äôs a certain ‚Äúway‚Äù the team likes to win. There‚Äôs a magic ‚Äî a pace ‚Äî that must spark to secure victory.</p>
            <p>Take the Hawks‚Äô 2020-21 season as an example. After suffering a losing record for the majority of the season, something transformed in late February. In remarkable form, the Hawks turned the season around, earning a ticket to the playoffs, winning the Southeastern Division, and stopping just shy of becoming Eastern Conference Champions and playing for the league title (but not before performing more than one heart-stopping comebacks).</p>
            <p>By all accounts, it was a remarkable season. But how did it happen?</p>
            <p>Some might say luck, some might say one or two skilled players, but I say different: It‚Äôs the magic of the Hawks.</p>
            <p>Atlanta teams tend to shy away from star-player-itis; they rarely have *the* person to consistently clinch championships, and if a team does, those players don‚Äôt tend to stick around.</p>
            <p>In 2018, Hawks fans collectively groaned when the team decided to trade its first-round, third overall pick, Luka Donƒçiƒá, and another future first-round picks for the skinny, short point guard, Trae Young.</p>
            <p>By the start of the season, Young put on 15 pounds of muscle, showing the first public signs that he had a lot to prove by way of skill, swagger, and, most important, teamwork.</p>
            <p>Now, in the ongoing 2021-22 season, the Hawks have not yet reached the pace they had last spring. As of Feb. 20, 2022, the team has a 28-30 record, but is ranked No. 2 in ESPN's John Hollinger's measurement for <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats">team efficiency</a>. Together, these circumstances provide an environment ripe for data analysis.</p>
            <p>Below, I‚Äôve used the Hawk‚Äôs two-player line-ups to assess partnerships between a select group of Hawks players, including:</p>
            <ul style=‚Äúlist-style-type:circle">
                <li>Trae Young</li>
                <li>Bogdan Bogdanovic</li>
                <li>Clint Capela</li>
                <li>John Collins</li>
                <li>Onyeka Okongwu</li>
                <li>Kevin Huerter</li>
                <li>Danilo Gallinari</li>
                <li>De‚ÄôAndre Hunter</li>
            </ul> </p>

                <h3 class="title is-4">
                    How do 2-player pairings *with* Young compare to those without him?
                </h3>
                
                <p>I‚Äôve assed all possible partnerships between these players, each other and the remaining Hawks roster, according to the 2-player lineups outlined on <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/traditional/?Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&GroupQuantity=2&TeamID=1610612737"
                    >NBA.com</a> (find out how I scraped the site's table by reading my code <a href="https://github.com/jessieblaeser/Trae-Young-Impact.git">here</a>).</p>
                <p><ul style=‚Äúlist-style-type:circle">
                    <li>A 53% increase in assists</li>
                    <li>A 44.9% increase in rebounds</li>
                    <li>A 55.5% increase in points</li>
                </ul></p>
 
        <div class="columns is-multiline is-mobile content">
            <div class="column is-full">
                <p>To some degree, the idea that Young would produce higher performance in these categories is unsurprising. He has the highest player efficiency rating on the Hawks, but he is not always the top performer in every single category. When it comes to rebounds, for example, Young averages 3.9 per game, far below Clint Capela‚Äôs 10.9 or John Collins‚Äôs 7.9.</p>
                <p>This begs the question: Does Young make his teammates better? When they play with Young, does the ball move faster, do plays get executed with more rigor, do players crash the boards harder, do more shots go up ‚Äî or are more shots made? </p>
                <p>There are too many confounding variables to count in this analysis, and the above graphic just scratches the surface of learning how Young might improve the performance of his fellow Hawks. But it‚Äôs worth exploring how he might spread the Hawks ‚ú®magic‚ú® to see if the data will show what fans see with their own eyes. </p>
                <h3 class="title is-4">
                    If Young-lineups outperform other 2-player lineups, how do each top player's lineups compare?
                </h3>
                <p>Below, we can see how the average assists, points and rebounds among each of the listed player‚Äôs 2-player lineups on the Hawks. In other words, each group of bars represents the player to the left‚Äôs game averages when paired with every other player on the team.</p>
                <figure class="image">
                    <img src="pairings_split_by_player.png" alt="Grouped bar chart showing Hawks' 2-player lineups average points, assists and rebounds per game.">

                <h3 class="title is-4">
                    Let's focus on assists
                </h3>
                <p>Assists are one of my favorite statistics in basketball. To me, they show selfless and high-IQ play, and Young is the perfect example as to why. Averaging 9.3 assists per game, Young‚Äôs ability to identify paths to the goal often translates to quick game-play and smart possessions.</p>
                <p>Below, you will see two graphics representing the Hawks‚Äô top players assists per game, again averaged among all possible 2-player lineups. Red dots show where each player falls on assists when paired with Young specifically. As you can see in the second chart, Young always falls above each players‚Äô mean assists/game among all pairings, and often falls in the upper 75th percentile.</p>

                    Now to rebounds
                </h3>
                <p>Young is not the top rebounder on the Hawks (try as he might). Nevertheless, the red dots in the figures below show that when Young is paired with each of the players to the left, their combined rebound rate per game goes up. This begs the question: Does Young‚Äôs presence on the floor encourage greater intensity among his teammates? The kind that might, perhaps, encourage other Hawks to crash the boards on a greater number of possessions? More statistical analysis is required to answer these questions, but for now, we have this:</p>
