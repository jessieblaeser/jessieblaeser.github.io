            <p>When it comes to the Atlanta Hawks, I like to think there’s a certain “way” the team likes to win. There’s a magic — a pace — that must spark to secure victory.</p>
            <p>Take the Hawks’ 2020-21 season as an example. After suffering a losing record for the majority of the season, something transformed in late February. In remarkable form, the Hawks turned the season around, earning a ticket to the playoffs, winning the Southeastern Division, and stopping just shy of becoming Eastern Conference Champions and playing for the league title (but not before performing more than one heart-stopping comebacks).</p>
            <p>By all accounts, it was a remarkable season.</p>
            <p>But how did it happen?</p>
            <p>Some might say luck, some might say one or two skilled players, but I say different: It’s the magic of the Hawks.</p>
            <p>Atlanta teams tend to shy away from star-player-itis; they rarely have *the* person to consistently clinch championships, and if a team does, those players don’t tend to stick around.</p>
            <p>In 2018, Hawks fans collectively groaned when the team decided to trade its first-round, third overall pick, Luka Dončić, and another future first-round picks for the skinny, short point guard, Trae Young.</p>
            <p>By the start of the season, Young put on 15 pounds of muscle, showing the first public signs that he had a lot to prove by way of skill, swagger, and, most important, teamwork.</p>
            <p>Now, in the ongoing 2021-22 season, the Hawks have not yet reached the pace they had last spring. As of Feb. 20, 2022, the team has a 28-30 record, but is ranked No. 2 in TK’s measurement for team efficiency. Together, these circumstances provide an environment ripe for data analysis.</p>
            <p>Below, I’ve used the Hawk’s two-player line-ups to assess partnerships between a select group of Hawks players, including:</p>
            <ul style=“list-style-type:circle">
                <li>Trae Young</li>
                <li>Bogdan Bogdanovic</li>
                <li>Clint Capela</li>
                <li>John Collins</li>
                <li>Onyeka Okongwu</li>
                <li>Kevin Huerter</li>
                <li>Danilo Gallinari</li>
                <li>De’Andre Hunter</li>
            </ul> </p>

                    How do 2-player pairings *with* Young compare to those without him?
                </h3>
                
                <p>I’ve assed all possible partnerships between these players, each other and the remaining Hawks roster, according to the 2-player lineups outlined on NBA.com (find out how I scraped NBA.com’s table by reading my code here).</p>
                <p><ul style=“list-style-type:circle">
                    <li>A 53% increase in assists</li>
                    <li>A 44.9% increase in rebounds</li>
                    <li>A 55.5% increase in points</li>
                </ul></p>
    
    <div class="container">    
        <section class="section">
        <div class="columns is-multiline is-mobile content">
            <div class="column is-full">
                <p>To some degree, the idea that Young would produce higher performance in these categories is unsurprising. He has the highest player efficiency rating on the Hawks, but he is not always the top performer in every single category. When it comes to rebounds, for example, Young averages 3.9 per game, far below Clint Capela’s 10.9 or John Collins’s 7.9.</p>
                <p>This begs the question: Does Young make his teammates better? When they play with Young, does the ball move faster, do plays get executed with more rigor, do players crash the boards harder, do more shots go up — or are more shots made? </p>
                <p>There are too many confounding variables to count in this analysis, and this graphic just scratches the surface of learning how Young might improve the performance of his fellow Hawks. But it’s worth exploring how he might spread the Hawks ✨magic✨ to see if the data will show what fans see with their own eyes. </p>

                <h3 class="title">Analysis</h3>
                <p>Following Bettles' code almost exactly, I applied Dijkstra's algorithm to the Ticket to Ride board in Python script. In doing so, I was able to determine the shortest route from one node (city) on the board to another. Analysis via NetworkX also allowed me to track the exact route a player would take to move in the most efficient way from each ticket card's origin city to its destination city. </p>
                <p>In each of the visualizations below, the darker the route between cities, the more ticket cards it contributes to when players are fulfilleing their respective ticket cards' origin and destination cities.</p>
                <p>But each visualization differs slightly.</p>
                <p>For every ticket card, there are multiple ways to move from Point A, the origin city, to Point B. Each visualization below uses a different number of possibilities a player might take to fulfill their ticket.</p>
                    
            <div class="card-image">
                <figure class="image is-5by4">
                    <img src="plots_ticket/heat_map_5_shortest.png" alt="Visualization of Ticket to Ride: Europe gameboard showing the probability of routes being taken by the end of the game">
                </figure>
              </div> 
              <p>In the above scenario, every ticket card has five possible "paths" to get from its origin to its destination. The darker the route, the more likely it is to be taken by a player. We can see that the center of the board has a heavy concentration of darker routes. Not only are these routes more likely to serve as connections on-route to a player's destination, but these routes also tend to be shorter, making them easier to claim.</p>
         </div> 
       


        <div class="container">    
            <section class="section">
            <div class="columns is-multiline is-mobile content">
                <div class="column is-full">

                        </figure>
                      </div> 
                      <div>
                        <p>But there are more than just five possible paths per ticket. Here, we are examining the likelihood of routes to be taken out of the 10 shortest possible paths to complete each ticket.</p>
                        <p>This number is bumped to 10 because perhaps five possible paths isn’t enough. Let’s say you’re trying to get from Palermo, Italy to Moscow, Russia — a ticket worth 21 points. You have many options to make that connection, but with those options come obstacles and decisions.</p>    
                        <p>For example, what if your desired routes have been blocked by other players? Or, what if you simply want to take the 10th-shortest route rather than the shortest route, opting to go through particular waypoints that fulfill your other ticket cards? This code looks at the 10-shortest possible paths from Palermo to Moscow and weighs each equally. It repeats this same process for each ticket card.</p>
                        <p>The result is the map above, which shows us, once again, that routes in the middle of the board are more likely to be used over the course of the game.</p>
                

                <div class="column is-full">
                    <div class="card-image">
                        <figure class="image is-5by4">
                            <img src="plots_ticket/heat_map_20_shortest.png" alt="Visualization of Ticket to Ride: Europe gameboard showing the probability of routes being taken by the end of the game">
                        </figure>
                      </div> 
                          <p>Now things are a bit unwieldy. The 20th-shortest route to get from Palermo, Italy to Moscow, Russia might not even exist — and if it does, it’s likely just another way to say “the longest route.”</p>
                          <p>Regardless, this visualization is still helpful in demonstrating the phenomenon at hand: cities in the middle of the board are more useful than those on the outside when a player is optimizing for the shortest route.</p>

                            <p>Next time you play Ticket to Ride, keep these keys in mind:
                                <ul style=“list-style-type:circle">
                                    <li>The board is most likely to be crowded in the middle.</li>
                                    <li>This means you can go for the middle early, opting to block it from other players or claim it for your own future use.</li>
                                    <li>Or, you can steer clear of the middle and prioritize circuitous routes. Choosing pathways along the periphery will help you avoid other players and could help you secure extra points for achieving the longest route.</li>
                                </ul>
