            <p>When it comes to the Atlanta Hawks, I like to think there’s a certain “way” the team likes to win. There’s a magic — a pace — that must spark to secure victory.</p>
            <p>Take the Hawks’ 2020-21 season as an example. After suffering a losing record for the majority of the season, something transformed in late February. In remarkable form, the Hawks turned the season around, earning a ticket to the playoffs, winning the Southeastern Division, and stopping just shy of becoming Eastern Conference Champions and playing for the league title (but not before performing more than one heart-stopping comebacks).</p>
            <p>By all accounts, it was a remarkable season. But how did it happen?</p>
            <p>Some might say luck, some might say one or two skilled players, but I say different: It’s the magic of the Hawks.</p>
            <p>Atlanta teams tend to shy away from star-player-itis; they rarely have *the* person to consistently clinch championships, and if a team does, those players don’t tend to stick around.</p>
            <p>In 2018, Hawks fans collectively groaned when the team decided to trade its first-round, third overall pick, Luka Dončić, and another future first-round picks for the skinny, short point guard, Trae Young.</p>
            <p>By the start of the season, Young put on 15 pounds of muscle, showing the first public signs that he had a lot to prove by way of skill, swagger, and, most important, teamwork.</p>
            <p>Now, in the ongoing 2021-22 season, the Hawks have not yet reached the pace they had last spring. As of Feb. 20, 2022, the team has a 28-30 record, but is ranked No. 2 in TK’s measurement for team efficiency. Together, these circumstances provide an environment ripe for data analysis.</p>
            <p>Below, I’ve used the Hawk’s two-player line-ups to assess partnerships between a select group of Hawks players, including:</p>
            <ul style=“list-style-type:circle">
                <li>Trae Young</li>
                <li>Bogdan Bogdanovic</li>
                <li>Clint Capela</li>
                <li>John Collins</li>
                <li>Onyeka Okongwu</li>
                <li>Kevin Huerter</li>
                <li>Danilo Gallinari</li>
                <li>De’Andre Hunter</li>
            </ul> </p>

                    How do 2-player pairings *with* Young compare to those without him?
                </h3>
                
                <p>I’ve assed all possible partnerships between these players, each other and the remaining Hawks roster, according to the 2-player lineups outlined on NBA.com (find out how I scraped NBA.com’s table by reading my code here).</p>
                <p><ul style=“list-style-type:circle">
                    <li>A 53% increase in assists</li>
                    <li>A 44.9% increase in rebounds</li>
                    <li>A 55.5% increase in points</li>
                </ul></p>
            </div>

    <div class="container">

        <div class="columns is-multiline is-mobile content">
            <div class="column is-full">
                <p>To some degree, the idea that Young would produce higher performance in these categories is unsurprising. He has the highest player efficiency rating on the Hawks, but he is not always the top performer in every single category. When it comes to rebounds, for example, Young averages 3.9 per game, far below Clint Capela’s 10.9 or John Collins’s 7.9.</p>
                <p>This begs the question: Does Young make his teammates better? When they play with Young, does the ball move faster, do plays get executed with more rigor, do players crash the boards harder, do more shots go up — or are more shots made? </p>
                <p>There are too many confounding variables to count in this analysis, and this graphic just scratches the surface of learning how Young might improve the performance of his fellow Hawks. But it’s worth exploring how he might spread the Hawks ✨magic✨ to see if the data will show what fans see with their own eyes. </p>
