                    <p>In 2018, Atlanta Hawks fans collectively groaned when the team decided to trade its first-round,
                        third overall pick, Luka Donƒçiƒá, and another future first-round pick for the skinny, short point
                        guard, Trae Young.</p>
                    <p>But by the start of the season, Young put on 15 pounds of muscle, indicating to fans he was ready
                        to prove something ‚Äî and did, by way of skill, swagger and, most important, teamwork.</p>
                    <p>Now, in the ongoing 2021-22 season, the Hawks have not yet reached the pace they had last spring.
                        As of Feb. 20, 2022, the team has a 28-30 record, but is ranked No. 2 in ESPN's John Hollinger's
                        measurement for <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/hollinger/teamstats">team efficiency</a>.
                        Together, these circumstances provide an environment ripe for data analysis.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, Young continues to break records for the Hawks, clearly contributing to the team‚Äôs
                        success when they find it, but by how much?</p>
                    <p>NBA.com keeps collective stats for every team‚Äôs lineup history. For five-, four-, three- and
                        two-player combinations, the site logs the number of games these combinations have played in
                        together, their collective offensive and defensive stats, and more.</p>
                    <p>Using this data, I wanted to measure Young‚Äôs impact on the player combinations he is a part of,
                        demonstrating just how much his presence on the floor increases a group‚Äôs performance, when
                        compared against group‚Äôs he is not a part of.</p>
                    <p>To do this, I used the Hawk‚Äôs two-player lineups to assess partnerships between a select group of
                        Hawks, including:
                    <ul style=‚Äúlist-style-type:circle">
                        <li>Trae Young</li>
                        <li>Bogdan Bogdanovic</li>
                        <li>Clint Capela</li>
                        <li>John Collins</li>
                        <li>Onyeka Okongwu</li>
                        <li>Kevin Huerter</li>
                        <li>Danilo Gallinari</li>
                        <li>De‚ÄôAndre Hunter</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>I chose to start with just three measures of success: average points, assists and rebounds per
                        game. In all three, Young improved the performance of the pairs of which he was a part by over
                        40 percent. Of all these measures, he improved points per game the most.</p>

                        </script>
                    </figure>

                    <p>To some degree, the idea that Young would improve the performance of his partnerships, compared
                        to partnerships without him, is not surprising ‚Äî he is the team‚Äôs best player.</p>
                    <p>But by comparing collective as opposed to individual stats, fans have a unique window into
                        something different: team performance and player chemistry rather than individual strengths (and
                        to read more about my methodology, you can find my code <a
                            href="https://github.com/jessieblaeser/Trae-Young-Impact.git">here</a>).</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, while Young might be the team‚Äôs best player, he is not its top performer by every
                        measure. When it comes to rebounds, for example, Young averages 3.9 per game, far below Clint
                        Capela‚Äôs 10.9 or John Collins‚Äôs 7.9.</p>

                    <figure class="image">
                        <iframe
                            title="Player pairs including Young average roughly 10 more rebounds per game than pairs without him"
                            aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-ux9eG"
                            src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ux9eG/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
                            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="360"></iframe>
                        <script type="text/javascript">!function () { "use strict"; window.addEventListener("message", (function (e) { if (void 0 !== e.data["datawrapper-height"]) { var t = document.querySelectorAll("iframe"); for (var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"]) for (var r = 0; r < t.length; r++) { if (t[r].contentWindow === e.source) t[r].style.height = e.data["datawrapper-height"][a] + "px" } } })) }();
                        </script>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Nevertheless, Young still has a substantial positive impact on the collective rebounds among his
                        partnerships, compared to partnerships without him. While Young averages less than four rebounds
                        per game himself, when he is paired with the players above, the pairs average roughly 20
                        rebounds per game, nearly doubling the average rebounds per game for these players pairings
                        without Young.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to assists, these Young‚Äôs bread and butter. He is ranked third overall in the NBA
                        for assists per game. But just how much does his gameplay influence his teammates‚Äô assists?
                        Could Young‚Äôs tendency to ball movement rub off on his teammates?</p>

                    <figure class="image">
                        <iframe
                            title="Player pairs including Trae Young average roughly 9 more assists per game than pairs without Young "
                            aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-oVRoS"
                            src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oVRoS/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
                            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="326"></iframe>
                        <script type="text/javascript">!function () { "use strict"; window.addEventListener("message", (function (e) { if (void 0 !== e.data["datawrapper-height"]) { var t = document.querySelectorAll("iframe"); for (var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"]) for (var r = 0; r < t.length; r++) { if (t[r].contentWindow === e.source) t[r].style.height = e.data["datawrapper-height"][a] + "px" } } })) }();
                        </script>
                    </figure>

                    <p>While Young adds roughly 9 more assists per game to collective performance when paired with these
                        players, he averages 9.3 assists per game himself.</p>
                    <p>If anything, it seems Young has the greatest impact on John Collins, who averages less than two
                        assists per game on his own. When Collins and Young play together, they average 16 assists per
                        game, showing these players improve each others‚Äô average performance when paired together.</p>
                    <h4>Conclusions:</h4>
                    <p>When I started this project, my goal was to not only demonstrate Young‚Äôs impact on his teammates‚Äô
                        pace, but to measure it. There are many more statistics I could have chosen, too many
                        confounding variables to count and infinite ways to display this data (for alternate versions of
                        this article with different data visualizations, click here). For now, I‚Äôm content with some
                        data-backed evidence that Young lifts his teammates up. That is the Hawks Way after all.</p>
